# Matlab2Arduino
This is a simple light weight example to connect an Arduino to Matlab and control a Servomotor which is connected to the Arduino.

Plug your Servomotor to your Arduino Uno by the following default mapping:
PinMapping by Default:
ServoControlPin: 9 ~
PowerServo: 5V Arduino
GNDpin: GND Arduino

Flash the Program MatlabArduinoServo onto your Arduino
Plug your Arduino to your computer USB-Port.
Start Servo.mlapp and select the correct COM-Port where your Arduino is plugged to. 
Have fun
